# Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project
## Coursera Specialization Ana Carmen Estrada Real

In this repository you are going to find:

 1. The **codebook.md** which explains the names of the variables and measurements.
 2. The **mydata.txt** file produced and exported by my R code.
 3. The **run_analysis.R** code which is my script with coments on how my code works and how I worked witht the data.

For the script to work suppose your working directory is where the folder ("UCI HAR Dataset") is just the way it is after the unzip process, the script will get your path and then enter to that folder every time it is reading data.

Just `source("run_analysis.R")` into R command line and the script should run smoothly.

The **mydata.txt** will also be written into your current working directory.
